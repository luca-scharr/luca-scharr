- 👋 Hi, I’m @luca-scharr
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, more specifically core AI and computer vision.
- 🌱 Currently I'm a PhD student at Paolo Favaros computer vision group at the university of Bern.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on point tracking (TAP, OF, and we can discuss BBox Tracking). I'd also be interested in exploring new training schemes, model architectures, design losses, structured datasets, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me; via e-Mail at luca.scharr at unibe.ch
