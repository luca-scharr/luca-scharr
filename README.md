- 👋 Hi, I’m @luca-scharr
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, more specifically core AI and computer vision.
- 🌱 Currently I'm a PhD student at Paolo Favaros computer vision group at the university of Bern.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D representation models, ideally having a monocular option. Obviously squishy objects over time are interesting here, especially with multi view models.
- 📫 How to reach me; via e-Mail at luca.scharr at unibe.ch
